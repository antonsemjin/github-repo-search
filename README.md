# GitHub Repository Search
My first small project in React. You can search for any user on GitHub and scroll through their public repositories until you've reached the end.

## How do I launch the project?
1. Run `npm install` in the project's directory
2. When that is finished, just start the server by typing `npm start` and you're good to go
3. Test the solution
